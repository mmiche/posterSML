## What do you want to know next about SML?

### I provide various files which you might be interested in (see main posterSML folder).

#### Q&A
A collection of questions which in hindsight I would have liked to be answered when I was an SML newbie. As with any answer, the answers I provide reflect my current point of view. Other people may see things differently.

#### SML recommendations
Just import the SMLrecommendations.bib document into your reference management software, e.g., zotero. This is of course only a very short list of articles. Browsing the web for 'supervised machine learning tutorial' will provide plenty of information to select from.
